# Titanic Dataset Analysis with Power BI
This project explores the famous Titanic dataset using Power BI, aiming to uncover insights through interactive visualizations and perform predictive analysis. The dataset contains various details about the passengers on the Titanic, such as age, gender, class, and survival status.

# Project Overview
1.Load and Explore the Data: Understand the structure and content of the dataset.
2.Data Cleaning: Handle missing values and perform necessary transformations.
3.Data Visualization: Create interactive visualizations to uncover patterns and insights using Power BI.
4.Dashboard Creation: Design a comprehensive dashboard to showcase the analysis.
5.Predictive Analysis: Implement predictive models to forecast passenger survival.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and is available in the repository. It includes the following columns:

1.PassengerId: Unique ID for each passenger.
2.Survived: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes).
3.Pclass: Passenger class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd).
4.Name: Name of the passenger.
5.Sex: Gender of the passenger.
6.Age: Age of the passenger.
7.SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic.
8.Parch: Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic.
9.Ticket: Ticket number.
10.Fare: Passenger fare.
11.Cabin: Cabin number.
12.Embarked: Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).

# Installation and Usage
